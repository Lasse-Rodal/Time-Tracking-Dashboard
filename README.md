## My process

### Built with

Certainly! Here's a simplified version of the list based on the components you used:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid Layout
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Fetch API - For API calls
- Google Fonts - For typography
- Hover effects
- CSS transitions

### What I learned

I learned how to create a responsive time-tracking dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with dynamic data fetching and interactive UI elements. I also experimented with using the `inherit` value for font properties and other styles.

### Continued development

Potential future development:

- Add dark/light mode toggle
- Implement real-time data updates
- Improve accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- Add user customization options (e.g., theme, layout)
- Optimize performance for large datasets
